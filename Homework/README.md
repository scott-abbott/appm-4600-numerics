## FAQ
What should HW submissions look like?  If it involves code and/or plots, see our [submission_guidelines](submission_guidelines.md)


**General instructions** for homeworks

Collaboration with your fellow students is OK and in fact recommended, although direct copying is not allowed. The internet is allowed for basic tasks (e.g., looking up definitions on wikipedia) but it is not permissible to search for proofs or to *post* requests for help on forums such as [math.stackexchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/) or to look at solution manuals. Please write down the names of the students that you worked with.  Please also follow our [AI policy](../policies.md#acceptable-use-of-ai-in-this-class).

An arbitrary subset of homework questions will be graded.

**Turn in a PDF** (either scanned handwritten work, or typed, or a combination of both) to **Gradescope**, using the link to Gradescope from our Canvas page. Gradescope recommends a few apps for scanning from your phone; see the [Gradescope HW submission guide](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf).

We will primarily grade your written work, and computer source code is *not* necessary (and you can use any language you want).  You may include it at the end of your homework if you wish (sometimes the graders might look at it, but not always; it will be a bit easier to give partial credit if you include your code).
For nicely exporting code to a PDF, see the [submission_guidelines](submission_guidelines.md).
