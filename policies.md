## Course Information
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md).

## Estimated Workload
This is intended to have a high workload, similar to Calculus III (which is 4 credits) and more than an elective class

## Prereqs
APPM 3310 (matrix methods).  Minimum grade of C-.

We used to require MATH 3430 or APPM 2360 (these are ODE and linear algebra courses), so it's not a bad idea to have these courses.

## Textbook
[Burden and Faires' textbook](https://sites.google.com/site/numericalanalysis1burden/) (9th or 10th edition) is our primary book, but homework problems will be written out explicitly, so it is not 100% necessary to purchase the book. This course has used this book in recent years, and it is used by the second semester class.

There are many other reasonable textbooks that can be used as a
supplement.  For example,

- [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation, by Driscoll and Braun, SIAM](https://fncbook.com/) from 2017. The first part of the book is free online, and they have examples in Matlab, Python and Julia (all good modern languages).
- Numerical Analysis, 1e, L. Ridgeway Scott
- Scientific Computing: an Introductory survey, by Michael T. Heath This has been used before (around 2018) for this class.
- [Numerical Mathematics, by Quarteroni, Sacco & Saleri, 2007](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781475773941) which is free on CU via SpringerLink. This is quite detailed and used for graduate courses sometimes.
- [Numerical Anaysis, by Tim Sauer](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Analysis-3rd-Timothy-Sauer/dp/013469645X). This is used by CSCI-3656 some semesters.
- [Numerical Methods: Design, Analysis, and Computer Implementation of Algorithms, by Anne Greenbaum and Tim P. Chartier, 2012](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691151229/numerical-methods), integrates with Perusall. Focuses on a few topics.

Other good ideas are at the [CSCI-3656 class](https://github.com/cu-numcomp/numcomp-class/blob/master/Syllabus.md#Resources); in particlar, Eijkhout (2017), Introduction to High-Performance Scientific Computing is much more high-performance implementation oriented.

## Syllabus
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md), the [high level schedule](./APPM%204600%20Spring%202026%20schedule.pdf), and the detailed [day-by-day schedule](schedule.md)

## Recitations/Labs
Tuesdays, led by the TA.

For each lab, you must attend in person (we take attendance), and then
turn in the required documents to Canvas by 11:59 PM on the day of the
lab (see the [submission
guidelines](./submission_guidelines.md)). This counts for 15% of your
grade.  Scoring per lab is done on a pass/fail basis.  We will
automatically give all students one "free" lab that you do not need to
turn in -- you do not need to tell us which lab, we automatically
remove one of your lowest scores.

## Exams
- There will be **two midterms** on 2/23/26 and 3/30/26, time (on or
  after 5pm) and location TBD.
- There is a **final** exam on Wednesday, April 29 from 7:30--10 PM.

## Projects

There are no projects this semester.  Some semesters, there has been a
final project instead of a final exam.

## Homeworks

There will be weekly homeworks.  You are allowed to drop 1 homework,
which will be done automatically.  Homework will be submitted via
Gradescope.  See the [submission guidelines](submission_guidelines.md).

## Grading

- 15% for lab/recitation days.
  - Half of the lab grad is obtained by attending your lab/recitation.
    The other half is obtained by turning in the lab assignment on time.
  - Each lab is pass/fail (you turn it in on time or you don't), but
    you are allowed one free "dropped" lab
- 30% Homework.
  - Late homework is not accepted, but you are allowed one free
    "dropped" homework. Your lowest-scoring homework will be
    automatically dropped.
- 30% Midterms (2 midterms, each 15%)
- 25% Final exam

The overall grade may be **curved** as appropriate, but note that
there is no set quota of A's, B's, etc., so you are not directly
competing with your classmates.

## Course website

We will use github for labs and demos and use CU's default LMT **Canvas** for
pretty much everything else (grades, homework, solutions, ...).

- We have some prerecorded videos on **youtube** from a Covid
  semester; these are unlisted, but we can email you the links if you
  have to miss class
- We'll use **gradescope** for grading (this integrates automatically
  with Canvas)

## Late assignment and cheating policy

In general, **late homework** assignments are not accepted; instead,
you can use your one dropped homework.  Under exceptional
circumstances such as a serious illness, homework can be turned in
late.  If the reason is foreseeable (e.g., planned travel), you must
contact the instructor in advance.

Examples:

- Your sister is getting married and you have to travel out-of-state.
  That's great, but this is when you use the one dropped
  homework. This is foreseeable, and not an emergency, so it does not
  count as an exceptional circumstance.
- A close family member becomes seriously ill and you have to return
  to your home country to take care of family.  This *does* count as
  an exceptional circumstance. Please email the instructor to discuss
  arrangements.

Similarly, **missing exams** are not made up except under the same
exceptional circumstances.

If you miss the **final exam** for a legitimate reason (as determined
by the instructor), then it may be an option to get an "Incomplete"
grade for the course and retake the final exam in a different
semester. Otherwise, you need to take the final exam.

**Cheating** is not acceptable.  Take-home exams and homeworks are
easy to cheat on if you really want to, but as this is an
upper-division course, I am relying on the fact that students are here
to learn (and paying the university to do so), and thus cheating does
not make sense.  Cheating does not harm the instructor, it harms the
student and all other students in the class.

If a student is caught cheating, on the first occurrence, the penalty
ranges from losing points on the item in question (like one test
problem; this is for very minor infractions) to losing all points for
the assignment (i.e., the entire homework or entire exam). Students
may be referred to the honor council. On the second occurrence of
cheating, similar penalties may apply, and additionally the student
may fail the class, at the instructor's discretion.

On homeworks, you are free to **collaborate** with other students, and
to use resources like the internet appropriately. However, you must do
your own work. There is a gray area between collaboration and
cheating, and we rely on the students' and instructors discretion.
Copying code verbatim is never permissible.  You should be writing up
your own work, and explaining answers in your own words.  Snippets of
code are allowed to be similar (sometimes there is only one good way
to do it), but longer chunks of code should never be identical.  If
not expressly forbidden by the assignment, you may use the internet,
but you may never post for help on online forums.

Cheating is not usually an issue in this class, and I have faith that
students will continue to act appropriately.

## Acceptable use of AI in this class

Students are allowed to:

- use "autocomplete" style coding assistance, like Copilot.  (*Why?
  because this is now as ubiquitious as spell-check, and it has become
  part of how people program.*) However, we strongly suggest you to
  use it sparingly, and to double-check!

- use LLMs to ask for documentation, but not with an AI that has
  access to your code. For example, you can google documentation and
  use the "AI generated summaries" provided by Google, but you cannot
  use Github copilot integrated with VS Code, or gemini integraded
  with colab (nor any context-aware chatbot).

- we **discourage** AI use whenever possible -- you don't need
  practice with it (it's easy!), and college is the time to practice
  your non-AI skills

- Tools like wolfram Alpha, Desmos, etc., are allowed unless
  explicitly disallowed for a particular problem, but we discourage
  their use. They will **not** be allowed on the midterms, so please
  do not get reliant on them.

Students are **not allowed** to:

- explicitly ask a LLM, like ChatGPT/Claude/..., to **solve** anything
	for you. This covers both code and math.
- For example, putting in the text of a homework problem and asking a
  LLM to generate the solution (or code) is not allowed.

#### Enforcement
For any major assignment (homework, or take-home exam if relevant),
the instructor reserves the right to randomly check students, and/or
check students with suspicious work.  If a student is checked, they
will need to do a live session with the instructor (either live-coding
if it is coding related, or a whiteboard session if it is math
related) so that the instructor can ask the student questions or give
them tasks.

#### Consequences of violating policy

- First-time minor violations of the AI policy will result in losing
  points on the specific problem; the amount of points lost is up to
  instructor discretion, depending on the severity of the infraction

- Major violations, or repeat violations, will result in a 0 on the
  entire relevant assignment

- Egregious and/or repeated major violations will result in failing
  the class


## Dropping the Course
Advice from your department advisor is recommended before dropping any
course. After [11:59 PM Jan 23,
2026](https://calendar.colorado.edu/event/spring-2026-last-day-to-drop-a-class-without-penalty-1159-pm?utm_campaign=widget&utm_medium=widget&utm_source=University+of+Colorado+Boulder),
dropping a course results in a "W" on your transcript and you’ll be
billed for tuition.

# Generic policies

## HONOR CODE
All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are
responsible for knowing and adhering to the [Honor
Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/students/honor-code-and-student-code-conduct). Violations
of the Honor Code may include but are not limited to: plagiarism
(including use of paper writing services or technology [such as essay
bots]), cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized
access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or
similar work in more than one course without permission from all
course instructors involved, and aiding academic
dishonesty. Understanding the course's syllabus is a vital part of
adhering to the Honor Code.

All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to Student
Conduct & Conflict Resolution: StudentConduct@colorado.edu. Students
found responsible for violating the Honor Code will be assigned
resolution outcomes from Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution and
will be subject to academic sanctions from the faculty member. Visit
[Honor
Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/students/honor-code-and-student-code-conduct)
for more information on the academic integrity policy.

## ACCOMMODATION FOR DISABILITIES, TEMPORARY MEDICAL CONDITIONS, AND MEDICAL ISOLATION
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please
submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your
faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.
Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented
disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting
accommodations is located on the [Disability Services
website](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/). Contact
Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <dsinfo@colorado.edu> for
further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition, see
[Temporary Medical
Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions)
on the Disability Services website.

If you have a temporary illness, injury or required medical isolation
for which you require adjustment, let the instructor know in writing
as soon as possible. The nature of the illness does not have to be
disclosed, and a doctor's note is not required. For most common
temporary illnesses, it is the student's responsibility to make up the
work.

## ACCOMMODATION FOR RELIGIOUS OBLIGATIONS
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty
make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who,
because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams,
assignments or required attendance.  In this class, if you must miss
the final exam due to religious reasons, talk to the instructor at the
**beginning of the semester** to make special arrangements. If the
homework is due on the date of a religious holiday, you are expected
to turn the homework in **early**. If you have a religious holiday
that lasts longer than one week, and so therefore you would not
receive the homework with enough time to turn it in early, talk to the
instructor at the beginning of the semester. For participation grades,
talk to the instructor the **week before** the holiday.

[//]: # ( In this class, {Faculty: insert your procedures here}. )

See the [campus policy regarding religious observances](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams) for full details.

## PREFERRED STUDENT NAMES AND PRONOUNS
CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information does not always
align with how they identify. If you wish to have your preferred name
(rather than your legal name) and/or your preferred pronouns appear on
your instructors’ class rosters and in Canvas, visit the [Registrar's
website](https://www.colorado.edu/registrar/students/records/info/preferred)
for instructions on how to change your personal information in
university systems.

## CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR
Students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate
learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person,
remote, or online. Failure to adhere to such behavioral standards may
be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are
especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing
with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability,
creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
expression, veteran status, marital status, political affiliation, or
political philosophy.

## SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND/OR RELATED RETALIATION
CU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming
learning, working, and living environment. University policy prohibits
[protected-class](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/policies/protected-class-nondiscrimination-policy/protected-class-definitions)
discrimination and harassment, sexual misconduct (harassment,
exploitation, and assault), intimate partner abuse (dating or domestic
violence), stalking, and related retaliation by or against members of
our community on- and off-campus. The Office of Institutional Equity
and Compliance (OIEC) addresses these concerns, and individuals who
have been subjected to misconduct can contact OIEC at 303-492-2127 or
email <OIEC@colorado.edu>. Information about university policies,
